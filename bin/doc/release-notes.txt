Release Notes
=============
Chiba version 1.4.0
-------------------
This is a maintainance release with fixes a lot of detail issues plus adds some new XForms 1.1 features here and there.
Most noteable is the migration to Maven 2 as a build tool to improve the build organisation of the rather grown
ant files. This is intended to ease the integration of Chiba in several different scenarios and provide up-to-date
versions of Chiba Core in our Maven repository.

Chiba version 1.3.0
-------------------
Countless fixes and corrections according to XForms 1.0 (Second Edition) have been made. The overall package structure
has been refactored a great deal for clarity. More than a dozen bugs have been fixed - some of them being serious ones.

But also a lot of improvements have been made: the Preprocessor has been removed for efficiency, some new XPath
functions have been introduced and a new StylesheetCache is in place. A more detailed change list can be found
 as always in changes.txt.

Chiba version 1.2.0
-------------------
Contains corrections to fix the vast majority of the XForms errata and moves Chiba to XForms 1.0 Second Edition.
Important areas of the source have been refactored for simplification and some performance improvements (100% in some areas). 
Many new tests have been introduced to ensure the new behaviour and some of the long-standing bugs have been fixed.

Chiba version 1.1.1
-------------------
This release mainly established the new modularization and changed build and distribution strategy. Chiba
now only contains the core XForms implementation along with all generic resources needed/usefull for any
XForms processing environment either client- or serverside. Main changes therefore are related to the build-file.

The ChibaAdapter interface has been refactored to condense some of the experiences with the different integrations.
Though, this process is still not complete.

Chiba version 1.1.0
-------------------
The Chiba distribution has been splitted into core and integration modules. This means that the core
XForms processor will be distributed as a separate download from now on. Integrations modules such as
Chiba-servlet, Chicoon and Convex will include Chiba as a jar-file. Files and tools relevant for multiple
modules will be kept in the core and exported to the different modules when necessary. 

Some of the unavoidable bugs of a 1.0.0 version have been fixed as well as some new features have been added (which
justify the 0.2 instead of a 0.1).  

Chiba version 1.0.0
-------------------
This is the first production-qualitiy release of Chiba. A lot of detail-work has been made on the
core, improving overall stability and efficiency as well as exception-handling. Another
few gaps to full spec conformance have been closed, e.g. XForms 1.0 Extension Functions now
also provide the missing date functions.

Known Issues:
There are still things defined in XForms 1.0 that Chiba does not support. A detailed conformance
